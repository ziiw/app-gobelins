## Starter ES6: React / Stylus / Browserify

### Why ?
Yes I know it's another JS starter, but I needed a starter for my projects, a starter that I know perfectly how it works etc... If you like the way I do, don't be shy and use it ;). I will be gracefull :D.

### No Tasks runner
I don't use tasks runners because I don't really need them. I used to use Gulp for my projects but I wanted something light and fast to build my starter (maybe one day I will build a task runner starter). So npm that's it :).

### First lunch
Installation needed for compilation:
``` sh
npm install -g browserify uglify stylus autoprefixer-stylus
```

Run:
``` sh
npm start
```

### Build cordova
``` sh
npm run build
```

### Todo
* Stylus minimal configuration :soon:
* React Router :soon:
* Flux branch
* Observables (RxJS || Bacon.JS || ...)
